# Face Detection with a Sliding Window

# Setup
- Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda). It doesn't matter whether you use 2.7 or 3.6 because the project creates its own environment.
- Create a conda environment, using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run this command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command. Modify the command based on your OS ('linux', 'mac', or 'win'): `conda env create -f environment_<OS>.yml`
- This should create an environment named `fr`. Activate it using the following Windows command: `activate fr` or the following MacOS / Linux command: `source activate fr`.
- Run the notebook using: `jupyter notebook ./code/proj5.ipynb`
